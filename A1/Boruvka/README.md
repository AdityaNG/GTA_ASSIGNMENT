# Boruvka's Algorithm to find MST

## TODO

1. Discombobulate the code
2. Graph input from file
3. Generate graph of size 100 vertices
4. Documentation

# Getting Started

Compilation on Linux:
```
make
```
Usage:
```
./Boruvka
```

Sample output:
```
Edge 0-3 included in MST
Edge 0-1 included in MST
Edge 2-3 included in MST
Weight of MST is 19
```
