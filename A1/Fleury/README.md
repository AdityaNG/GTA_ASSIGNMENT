# Fleury's Algorithm to find Euler's Circuit

## TODO

1. Discombobulate the code
2. Graph input from file
3. Generate graph of size 100 vertices
4. Documentation

# Getting Started

Compilation on Linux:
```
make
```
Usage:
```
./fleury
```

Sample output:
```
2-0  0-1  1-2  2-3
0-1  1-2  2-0
0-1  1-2  2-0  0-3  3-4  4-2  2-3  3-1
```
